# Jacdac Device Development Kit (DDK) Reference Materials

## Introduction

This repository contains reference materials for creators of [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac) devices. More specifically, it has technical drawings, part libraries and device designs (schematics and layout files). In conjunction with the [Jacdac device design documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/ddk/) and our [Jacdac firmware repositories](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/ddk/firmware/), these materials form the Jacdac device design kit (DDK). The DDK contains everything necessary to design and manufacture [Jacdac devices](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/devices/).

Please also refer to discussions at https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/discussions and note that issues are tracked on https://github.com/microsoft/jacdac/issues.

## Repository structure

-   `/connector`: specification of the Jacdac PCB connector, cable connector and cable assemblies;
-   `/electronics`: reference materials and implementations of different types of device in the form of schematics, layouts and parts libraries for various electronics CAD packages;
-   `/enclosures`: files relating to enclosures for Jacdac modules and devices; and
-   `/graphics`: image files that might be useful for device design, packaging and/or marketing materials.

Note that the contents of any files under a `deprecated_form_factor` or `explorations` folder are provided for interest only, these should not be considered reference material relating to the Jacdac standard.
